## Project Summary

One area of fashion is completely overlooked in terms of accessibility and user friendliness- the fragrance industry. The subjectivity of fragrance allure and the at times inordinate prices can drive away individual consumers looking to experiment with their personal style and experience. The fragrance industry is overpopulated by ancient reputations held by designer brands that only offer standard variations of beaten-to-death scents, and many unique fragrances lack the exposure to actually end up in consumersâ€™ homes. 
	We wish to solve this problem with our platform, Scentastic: a website that displays a wide variety of consumer fragrances alongside price and images, with our unique ScentScore - compiled using a review dataset from real people instead of bot or bland reviews. We prioritize highlighting the unicorns of the fragrance industry by allowing users to search based on price point and ScentScore, as well as a user-focused quiz called ScentSense- allowing users to pick either notes, smells, or tones within the fragrance, or desired results from using a fragrance, such as attraction, respect or calming. This allows us to deliver the perfect fragrance for users at their price point and preference.
